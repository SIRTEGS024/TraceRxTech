    Legality: Products must also be produced in accordance with the relevant legislation of the country of production, including laws on land use rights, environmental protection, forest-related rules, and human rights.
    Due Diligence: Companies (operators and large traders) are required to implement a robust due diligence system, including information gathering, risk assessment, and risk mitigation, and submit a due diligence statement for relevant products.`
